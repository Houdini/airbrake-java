DONE
De-Toad it. Update all hoptoad references to Airbrake
Update to new API + Endpoint
    
Refresh the docs. We can help with that. 
Provide similar features as "Going Beyond Exceptions" https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake#going-beyond-exceptions 
Allow for filtering. https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake#filtering 

Dealing with Threads. I'm not sure how this could be solved. I would value your thouhgts on this.
I do not know how hard it would be, but it would be nice to allow a list of back traces and each back trace to have its own optional message. e.g. Using the current implementation of the java notifier, if an exception comes through log4j I can either report the message from log4j or the one on the Throwable, not both and I cannot seem the find how to display the "caused by". This is a huge blocker for us at work and should there be a way to do it with the hoptoad API, I would be more than happy to add the feature to the java notifier.

This may be something we need to do on the API, but is something we would look at.
Other stuff. What else could we do it make it beter? 
Extended it. Mainly supporting JRuby. http://marxsoftware.blogspot.com/2009/05/jrubys-ruby-style-exception-handling.html  http://jruby.org/apidocs/org/jruby/exceptions/RaiseException.html
